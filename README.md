# -Signals-in-the-Noise
A cryptic message is buried deep within a web page. To uncover the flag, you must navigate through layers of hidden signals and forgotten codes. Only those who understand "iddy umpty" will reveal the truth.


Hints:
 1.Look beyond what is immediately visible.
 2.A binary rhythm forms the path forward.
 3.Patterns in sound hold more than just noise.
 4.The final message is encodedâ€”you must decode it.
